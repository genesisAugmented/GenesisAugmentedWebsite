								<h3>The Story So Far...</h3>
								<p>From the ashes of eternal chaos and darkness, a new light was rekindled, creating all that is our universe. As worlds began to spawn upon the infinite plane, three celestial beings played the great harmony known as Ex nihilo (Out of Nothing). (Orios) the hands of creation, (Kromora) the eyes of fate and (Gaia) the blood of life worked in cohesion to create an entity. By sacrificing their own physicality, souls and power, a greater being was born residing in all things and releasing its power all across the universe. It is the flow of time, the expanse of space, the master of the void, the core of creation, the soul of the universe itself, it is the spirit of Genesis.</p>

								<p>But upon the universeâ€™s conception, Rharkon, the old one interrupted the harmony of Ex Nihilo and plagued the beautiful music with violent sounds of chaos and evil that wrought destruction across the harmony. Orios, Kromora and Gaia battled Rharkon for years beyond count until finally Rharkon was destroyed, but his work had already been done. His malevolent chaos plagued the conception of Genesis, his dark influence made the strings of time and space twisted and unbound. The universe was ridden with a sickness and from it poured rifts, tears within its flesh and bone, bringing disruption to the natural flow and mechanisms of the universe.</p>

<!-- 								<h4>Where You Come In...</h4> -->
								<p>These disruptions in time and space are known as rifts, passageways between worlds and ages. All sorts of lifeforms travel between these passageways bringing disorder and chaos. Beasts and Gods battle across the universe and across the ages, you have been chosen to rid the universe of this plague. You are a Riftlord, a mortal chosen by Genesis itself to end this disorder. Gifted with godlike abilities and the power to control those that come through rifts. Riftlords are the defenders of Genesis and are given the responsibility to keep order and peace across the universe. You must venture forth into the unknown and build an army of powerful beings from across different worlds and different ages. The spirit of Genesis will be your guide on this journey and will help you unlock the secrets of the mysterious rifts. Riftlord the fate of the universe is in your hands.</p>
